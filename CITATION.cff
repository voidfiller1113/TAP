abstract: >-
  TAP is a formal specification for bridging the structural void between 
  Concept (L3) and Implementation (L1). It defines the Structure (L2) 
  through which all intent must pass to become execution. Conformance 
  requires Deterministic Actors; human-only implementations are Non-Compliant.
